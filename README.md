# Shakespeare Naive Bayes classification
Classification algorithm that sorts Shakespeare plays into comedy/history/tragedy based on training data from the more easily categorized works.

Requirements: must have scikitlearn, NumPy, SciPy – http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html

On Mac OS X:

sudo easy_install pip

sudo pip install scikit-learn

Run the file: python shakes_classification.py

Based on example code written by my Machine Learning teacher, which I then modified. Naive Bayes algorithms are from scikitlearn -- more info here: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html . Shakespeare play texts are from http://shakespeare.mit.edu/ .
